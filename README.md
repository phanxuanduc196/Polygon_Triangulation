# PolygonTriangulation
Project of Computational Geometry using Kong Algorithm to Polygon Triangulation

The main language for this source code is Java.

## The system includes:
- ``KONG`` algorithm to perform finding the least number of polygons with given space.
- Demo: Using ``Java`` to show result.
